# Rabin Public Key Encryption

The **Rabin cryptosystem** is an asymmetric [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic) technique, whose security, like that of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29), is related to the difficulty of [integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization).

{% hint style="info" %}
So attacks on RSA can be applied on Rabin cryptosystem.
