# Euler's phi function

## Definition 

Euler's phi \(or totient\) function of a positive integer $$n$$ is the number of integers in $$\{1,2,3,...,n\}$$ which are relatively prime to $$n$$. This is usually denoted $$\Phi(n)$$. For a prime number $$p$$,

$$
\Phi(p)=p-1
$$

If $$p,q$$are prime numbers, and $$N=pq$$,

$$
a^{\Phi(N)}\equiv (p-1)(q-1)
$$

If $$gcd(a,p)=1$$,

$$
a^{\Phi(p)}\equiv 1\pmod p
$$
