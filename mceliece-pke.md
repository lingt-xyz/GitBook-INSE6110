# McEliece PKE

* Based on error-correcting codes
* Select a particular code for which an efficient decoding algorithm is known, then to disguise it as a general linear code
* The problem of decoding an arbitrary linear code is NP-hard
  * description of the original code can serve as the private key
  * while a description of the transformed code serves as the public key 
* Very inefficient but the key size is very large
