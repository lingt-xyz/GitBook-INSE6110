# Block Cipher

## Hill Cipher

Hill Cipher is a type of block cipher. Its key is a matrix$$M$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
If we change one letter in the plaintext, all the letters of the ciphertext will be affected.
{% endhint %}

In order to decrypt we need the inverse of key matrix $$M$$.

### Properties

1. Diffusion: one character change in the plaintext should effect as many ciphertext characters as possible, and vice versa.
2. Confusion: The key/plaintext should not relate to the ciphertext in a simple way.

### Example

## One Time Pad
