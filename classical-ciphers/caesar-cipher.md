# Caesar Cipher

Shift letters by a given key.

Defined over $$Z_{26}$$ as follows:



## Algorithm

1. Convert each letter in the plaintext $$P$$ to its corresponding number.
2. Shift the number by the given key $$K$$ and do a module over the size of the space.
3. The output of the module is the ciphertext.
